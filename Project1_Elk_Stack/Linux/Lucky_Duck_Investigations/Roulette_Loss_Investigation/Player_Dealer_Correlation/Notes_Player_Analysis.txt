# Step 3.A.2 - use grep to isolate losses from March 10, 12, 15
# used grep -e - 031*_win_loss_player_data to retrieve all losses with losses from all relevant files at once

# Step 3.A.3 - Place those results in a file called Roulette_Losses
# used grep -e - 031*_win_loss_player_data > Roulette_Losses to place these lines in a new file called Roulette_Losses



# Step 3.A.4 part 1 - "times the losses occurred each day"
Losses were incurred at the following dates and times
# Used awk '{print $1,$2}' Roulette_Losses >> Notes_Player_Analysis to print the following lines
0310_win_loss_player_data:05:00:00 AM
0310_win_loss_player_data:08:00:00 AM

# Step 3.A.4 part 2 - "Is there a certain player that was playing during each of those times?"
# Used personal visual analysis looking at files to find individual whose name appeared in each line
Mylie Schmidt was playing during each of these times.


# Step 3.A.4 part 3 - total count of times this player was playing
# used grep 'Mylie Schmidt' 031*_win_loss_player_data | wc -l 
# in the Roulette_Player_WinLoss_0310 directories to return total count of times this player was playing for all dates we have data for
Mylie Schmidt played a total of 34 times between 0310 and 0317

# used grep 'Mylie Schmidt' 0310_win_loss_player_data 0312_win_loss_player_data 0315_win_loss_player_data | wc -l 
# in Roulette_Player_WinLoss_0310 directory to return total count of times this player was playing on the 3 dates in question (0310, 0312, 0315)
